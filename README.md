# Manus SDK Integration for SharpaWave

This repository is used for integration and demonstration of SharpaWave with Manus MetaGloves Pro, including a Manus data acquisition client and hand retargeting examples.

## Overview

The project is organized into two main components:

- `client/`: Linux client based on Manus SDK (C++), responsible for glove data acquisition and publishing.
- `retargeting/`: Retargeting and visualization modules (Python), responsible for mapping keypoints to SharpaWave joint space.
